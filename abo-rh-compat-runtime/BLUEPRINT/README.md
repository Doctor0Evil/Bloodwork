# Neurotech / BCI / EEG / MCI Platform Blueprint

This repository hosts an open reference backend for brain-computer interface (BCI), EEG, and neurotech applications, designed for:

- Clinical and academic research labs
- Medical device manufacturers
- Brain-computer interface startups
- Human-computer interaction and cognitive science teams

Artifacts:
- BLUEPRINT.json: machine-readable description of APIs, data flows, and policies.
- SHA256.txt: integrity hash for released BLUEPRINTs.

Use this repo as a public, versioned reference backbone for lawful, privacy-preserving EEG/BCI experimentation and integration.
