# Bloodwork
Bloodwork is a cybernetic, and augmented-human experimental-research study that develops unique prototypes for biomechanical-engineering of cybernetic-software, hardware, and firmware, designed for-use in lab-environments, and studies/environments where biocompatibility, meets programmatic-interoperability, bridging the ai-human gap in technology.
